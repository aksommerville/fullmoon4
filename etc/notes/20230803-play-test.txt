Art heist: Noticed the broken frame.
(ak) Maybe farmer should be faster? We didn't see him emerge.
Beach gate: Hilarity!
(ak) It's not clear that you need to leave the beach after getting Compass. -- Move Compass to swamp, just give it away.
(ak) North pole: Try not to allow blowback to engage while on land.
Beach sign? Didn't get at first.
(ak) We definitely need to give the shovel earlier.
Two visits to village, and didn't enter Church.
Violin: Feels like it doesn't work.
(ak) Get violin at the music lesson shop? YES. Remove lock.
Dammit Alex, go back to the swamp!
(ak) Seeds are helpful if you're lost, but it takes some doing to even get them.

Gamma/alpha educator: Pushed pushblock off axis, and left.
Static educator: "It's a feather" "How the fuck is that a feather?"
Alpha block: Tried left*1 up*2 right*3 down*4. Can we communicate that that's not a count? Definitely don't use numbers. Arrows like a clover?
(ak) Static educator: Use treadles, not a connecting pushblock.
BUG! Can push alphablock via intervening pushblock.
(ak) Don't trap in the wand part? Or lead to Umbrella first? Don't make them repeat the swamp.

Wand to lead to Shovel. (have Umbrella, Violin, Feather, Compass, Wand, Pitcher).
(ak) Free seeds in Dot's house?
(ak) Put Seamonster Pong near the Umbrella, duh.
Music teacher: Broader range. Or seriously, why not just anywhere on screen?
Farming one cell at a time.
More hat trolls outside. It's just slightly too easy to get past without the hat. -- Put Hat in the caves.
(ak) Allow "R" with negative slope
Pumpkin on the wall in castle, doesn't read.
Snuck past dragons. Can stand inside of the left-facing one.
Tickle dragon on neck, in addition to head.
Tight-corridor affordance for lambda and charmed pushblock. -- also stop briefly at cell boundaries.
(ak) alphablocks should give some feedback, a positive and negative beep.
Castle 2f inner switches: Got it by checking, didn't use broom.
Really stumped by OTP, without having gotten to the write-point.
2:51:09.019

Castle 2f 2-alpha-blocks and water: Use a conveyor belt to prevent lambda from going down vertical.
