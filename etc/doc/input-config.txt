Full Moon Input Config File Format
Only applies to platforms using inmgr -- at the moment, that's everything except web.
It's conceivable that highly-specific platforms might not use inmgr; in that case they likely wouldn't have any input config at all.

A file "input" is created adjacent to the executable. (adjacent to the bundle for MacOS).

Line-oriented text. Hash begins a line comment.
Order matters! New devices are tested against each block in order and the first match wins.
Comments and formatting will be lost when the game auto-saves, if you reconfigure a device in-game.
*** All integers are hexadecimal with no prefix. ***

Organized into blocks beginning:
  device VID PID NAME
  
Followed by any number of rules:
  SRCBTNID [SRCPART] [DSTTYPE] DSTBTNID
  SRCBTNID is a plain integer.
  DSTBTNID is a button or action string: LEFT RIGHT UP DOWN USE MENU ; quit fullscreen pause step screencap save restore mainmenu
  (See src/app/fmn_platform.h:FMN_INPUT_* and src/opt/bigpc/bigpc_internal.h:BIGPC_ACTIONID_*)
  SRCPART identifies the portion of SRCBTNID's range to use:
    btn     : 2-state buttons. Default, you may omit.
    lo hi   : 3-way axes.
    n e s w : Hats
  DSTTYPE is the namespace for DSTBTNID and may be omitted: button, action. If omitted, we try button first, then action.
