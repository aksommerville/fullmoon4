# Full Moon

Non-violent adventure game where the witch has to find and kill the werewolf.

I mean "non-violent" in a pretty loose sense.
Because there is definitely a werewolf-slaying involved.

Tentatively aiming for full release 29 September 2023, the first full moon of autumn.

- [ ] Steam
- - [ ] Must reach "Coming Soon" two weeks ahead of release -- 2023-09-15
