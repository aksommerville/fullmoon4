# Full Moon

Non-violent adventure game where the witch has to find and kill the werewolf.

I mean "non-violent" in a pretty loose sense.
Because there is definitely a werewolf-slaying involved.

## TODO

I want this thing ready to show off at GDEX 2023. Anything not necessary for demoing there can wait.

And tentatively aiming for full release 29 September 2023, the first full moon of autumn.

### April

- [ ] Linux DRM platform, why not.
- - [ ] stdsyn
- - [x] DRM, validate
- - [ ] minsyn
- - [ ] After that works, try for MacOS too. Web works on the MacBook but it's a strain.
- - - Prediction: A native build will run like butter, no strain at all.
- [ ] Handle gamepad hats. eg Black-on-black gamepad on the MacBook.
- [ ] Web and gl2 renderers: Can we draw the hero on top, after pan transitions? So she's not cut in half.
- [ ] alsa: Seems we are delaying sometimes at startup. Can we open it async or something?
- - Confirm that it really is ALSA. Only I noticed it when VLC was running, so assume it's audio-related.
- [ ] gl2: Cheese whiz.
- [ ] bigpc: clock
- - [ ] bigpc_autobloom_plants, once the clock works
- [ ] gl2: victory menu. Presentation, but also we need to reset after ack and that's not happening yet.
- [ ] bigpc: validate buried doors, they probably won't auto-open second visit
- [ ] bigpc: validate static wind, probably not happening due to unset wind_time
- [ ] bigpc: initial sketches. Desired behavior is initials only show up if there are none from the store. I believe we're currently doing them a la carte.
- [ ] bigpc: map callbacks
- [ ] bigpc: gameover song change
- [x] glx: initial window size should be a multiple of the framebuffer size

### May

- [ ] Trick floor: Would it help to gently suck the hero into the center of each tile? to prevent overstepping, i mean
- [ ] Raccoon mind control: Don't wait for the decision cycle, make it immediate.
- [ ] Order merch.
- - [ ] Stickers and pins: Stickermule (they do t-shirts too but too expensive)
- - [ ] T-shirts. (Bolt is cheapest I've found, and they did good with Plunder Squad. UberPrints looks ok but more expensive)
- - [ ] Baseball cards: Get in touch with Lucas, maybe we can do a full-GDEX set of cards? Emailed 2023-03-11. Gotprint.com: $35/250. 875x1225px
- - Probly no need for thumb drives if we've only got the demo.
- [ ] Beta test.
- [ ] Pretty up the public web page.
- [ ] Lively intro splash.
- [ ] Bonus secret 2-player mode: Second player is a ghost that can make wind.
- [ ] The Cheat Book. A nice looking "WARNING SPOILERS" notebook we can leave out for demo players.
- [ ] Correct song and sound effect levels. Automated analysis?
- [ ] Track travel. Use for crow guidance, and report coverage at the end. Flag maps eg border as "not participating in coverage".
- - Or use a "set gsbit" map command, for selected maps only? Coverage reporting is not a big priority.
- [x] Book of Spoilers

### After GDEX

- [ ] inmgr: Real input mapping.
- [ ] UI for saved game management.
- [ ] Building resources is too slow. Rewrite all those Node tools in C.
- [ ] Soft render.
- [ ] Data editor improvements.
- - [ ] Home page
- - [ ] MapAllUi: Point out neighbor mismatches.
- - [ ] MapAllUi: Populate tattle.
- - [ ] Delete maps (and resources in general)
- - [ ] ImageAllUi: Show names
- [ ] Build-time support for enums and such? Thinking FMN_SPRITE_STYLE_ especially, it's a pain to add one.
- [ ] Map dark, indoors, blowback... Can we make a "map flags" field to contain these?
- [ ] verify: analyze map songs, ensure no map could have a different song depending on entry point
- [ ] verify: Check neighbor edges cell by cell (be mindful of firewall). Open no-neighbor edges must have blowback.
- [ ] verify: Tile 0x0f must be UNSHOVELLABLE in all tile sheets.
- [ ] verify: Song channel 14 reserved for violin, songs must not use.
- [ ] verify: Teleport targets must set song.
- [ ] verify: Firewall must be on edge, with at least two vacant cells, and a solid on both ends.
- [ ] verify: Chalk duplicates
- [ ] verify: Resources named by sprite config, eg chalkguard strings
- [ ] verify: 'indoors' should be the same for all edge neighbors, should change only when passing thru a door
- [ ] verify: buried_treasure and buried_door. shovellable, etc
- [ ] Remove hard-coded teleport targets, store in the archive (fmn_spell_cast).
- [ ] Make up a new item to take Corn's place.
- [ ] Maps for full game.
- [ ] Pumpkin protection: Ensure she can't travel too far as a pumpkin, and can't get trapped in the reachable area.
- [ ] Ensure maximum update interval is short enough to avoid physics errors, eg walking thru walls. Currently 1..50 ms per Clock.js
- [ ] Detect heavy drops in requestAnimationFrame rate and stop music if too low.
- [ ] Rekajigger Constants.js, use actual inlinable constants.
- [ ] Filter resources by qualifier, see src/tool/mkdata/packArchive.js
- [ ] Translation.
- [ ] Web input: Key events are triggering the pause button when focussed. Why isn't it just space bar?
- [ ] Touch input.
- [ ] Input configuration.
- - [ ] Generalize mapping, see src/www/js/game/InputManager.js
- - [ ] Persist gamepad and keyboard mapping.
- - [ ] UI for mapping.
- [ ] Extra mappable input actions, eg hard pause and fullscreen toggle. I specifically don't want these for the demo, so punt.
- [ ] Finish everything by Halloween. (to this point in the list at least)
- [ ] Consider WebGL for rendering. CanvasRenderingContext2D is not performing to my hopes.
- [ ] Unit tests.
- - [ ] General-purpose test runner.
- - [ ] C tests
- - [ ] JS platform tests
- [ ] Automation against headless native build.
- [ ] Other platforms:
- - [ ] Web wrapper eg Electron
- - [ ] Linux
- - [ ] Tiny. I don't think it will work, but prove it.
- - [ ] MacOS
- - [ ] Windows
- - [ ] iOS
- - [ ] Android
- - [ ] Pippin
- - [ ] PicoSystem
- - [ ] Thumby
- - [ ] PocketStar
- - [ ] Playdate
- - [ ] 68k Mac
- - [ ] Wii
- - [ ] Modern consoles?
- - [ ] node or deno? Shame to write all this Javascript and use it for just one platform...
