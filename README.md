# Full Moon

Non-violent adventure game where the witch has to find and kill the werewolf.

I mean "non-violent" in a pretty loose sense.
Because there is definitely a werewolf-slaying involved.

Tentatively aiming for full release 29 September 2023, the first full moon of autumn.

- [ ] MacOS: Compare iMac to MacBook builds. Are they identical? Can each run on the other machine?
- [ ] Info site downloads: Emphasize most recent version and inferred platform. (sorting isn't enough).

- [ ] Art and music for info site.
- [ ] Steam
